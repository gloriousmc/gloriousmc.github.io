         <h4>Commands</h4>
         <p>This is a calm 100% command-block-run vanilla server. That means no confusing plugins or gimmicks. To us, vanilla is the flavor of being simple.</p>
         <p>Although plugins were the easy way out, we wanted a challenge. That ment that we had to use Command Blocks. We had to use commands like:</p>
         <code>
         /execute @a[team=hide1] ~ ~ ~ summon leash_knot ~ ~ ~ {CustomName:Center}<br>
         /scoreboard players set @a[score_hay=1,score_hay_min=1] hay 0
         </code><br>
         <p><br>That's just a few of them. There are many more commands that make our server possible. In fact, there are even commands that you wouldn't even think are there.</p>
         <p>Have you ever heard of /trigger? It's used to execute a scoreboard by a player.</p>
         <code>
           /trigger grass set 1
         </code><br>
         <p><br>/trigger was used in the making of the morph book for the hiders.</p>
         <p>If you're thinking about trying out various commands and messing with command blocks, YouTube and Minecraft Forum are good places to start. To get a command block, just do <code>/give @p command_block</code></p>

         <h4>3rd Party Programs</h4>
         <p>Some things would not be possible without some extra help. Programs like <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-tools/1262665-nbtexplorer-nbt-editor-for-windows-and-mac">NBTExplorer</a>helped style the username prefixed and objective display names.</p>
        
         <p>I first noticed this is beta 2. I took it from the iPhone Simulator SDK in the UIKit.framework. There doesnt seem to be anything in the actual UIKit framework running on iOS. Alot is mentioned of the notification center, now at first i thought that it was used in a older firmware so i checked the iOS 9 and 8 simulator SDK's and neither had the <code>-[UIApplication _registerForSystemwideDarkModeChangeNotification];</code>function. Here is the function below.<br></p>
